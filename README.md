# Jewelry Management System (JMS) Software Testing Project

## Introduction

This project aims to test the **Jewelry Management System (JMS)** software, a system designed to support the management and optimization of jewelry business operations. JMS provides tools for managing products, product categories, suppliers, purchase and sales orders, as well as essential functions like login, registration, and a homepage display.

## Objective

The goal of this testing project is to ensure that JMS software meets all quality requirements, functions correctly, and is free from critical bugs. We perform functional, non-functional, and security testing to enhance user experience and improve software performance.

## Project Structure

1. **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**  
   The SRS document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for JMS, including system requirements, main features, performance, and security requirements. It serves as a key reference for project members during development and testing.

2. **Source Code and Installation Guide**  
   - **Source Code**: Contains the source code for the JMS software.
   - **Installation Guide**: Detailed instructions for deploying and installing JMS on a computer for testing and usage.

3. **Test Plan and Test Case Specification**  
   - **Test Plan**: A comprehensive testing plan with strategies and testing scope, ensuring all main features of the system are thoroughly tested.
   - **Test Case Specification**: Detailed specifications for each test case executed during the testing process.

4. **Test Cases**  
   - **Black-box Testing**: Functional testing based on system requirements without examining the internal structure.
   - **White-box Testing**: Testing the internal structure of the system's source code.
   - **Unit Testing**: Testing individual modules or functions using tools like JUnit or NUnit for key functionalities.
   - **Automated Testing**: Automated testing of main features using tools like Selenium or Robot Framework. These tests are carried out in labs similar to Lab1, Lab2, and Lab3.

5. **Test Report**  
   A detailed report on testing outcomes, including the results of each test case, system performance, and software stability.

6. **Defect and Bug List**  
   A compilation of bugs found during testing, including bugs identified through static testing, document review, and code review.

7. **Team Evaluation**  
   Team member performance evaluations, using self-evaluation and peer-evaluation files as per the "Evaluation.rar" template.

## Key Features of the JMS System

- **Login/Register**: User account management.
- **Homepage**: Main interface displaying an overview.
- **Product Management**: Add, edit, delete, and view product details.
- **Product Type Management**: Manage product categories.
- **Supplier Management**: Manage supplier information.
- **Purchase Order Management**: Track and manage incoming orders.
- **Sales Order Management**: Process and manage outgoing orders.

## Expected Outcome

Upon project completion, we will provide:
- A comprehensive test report on JMS software quality.
- A defect list and necessary bug-fixing suggestions.
- A detailed evaluation of each team member's contribution.

## Tools Used

- **Notion/Trello**: Task and progress management.
- **Selenium Framework**: Automated testing.
- **JUnit/NUnit**: Unit testing.
- **Agile/Scrum**: Methodology for project management.
